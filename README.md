# Spinlab-Curve-Fitting-Library
Python library that performs non-linear regression curve fitting utilizing the scipy.optimize package and plotting using matplotlib.

The SpinlabCF library is a wrapper on top of scipy.optimize and matplotlib.  It provides easy loading of data files, and performs most the steps needed to set up, run, and interpret/plot the results from scipy.optimize.curve_fit

Download and place SpinlabCF.py in the same directory as your curve-fitting script.  SpinlabCF_template.py provides a demonstration of how to use the features of the library.  These demonstrated features are documented as they are used in the template.

This library is only compatible with Python 3.x and requires the packages scipy, numpy, and matplotlib.
